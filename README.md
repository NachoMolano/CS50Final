#### Description: 
My final project is a simple website, hosted online in Render, made for students to be able to manage their grades, and communicate with their classmates through a groupchat and a shared calendar. The app was made in Python using the Flask framework and SQLite3 to manage my database. Other libraries such as SocketIO, FullCalendar.io, jQuery and more were used to develop the website. It also includes a Login/Signup menu, and users are managed via flask_session and SQLite3. 
## Acknowledgments

This project was developed with the assistance of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The AI tool provided valuable guidance and suggestions during the development process, particularly in areas such as Flask with SocketIO, FullCalendar.io and Render, to achieve enough understanding to be able te write the code myself.

While the ideas and final implementation are my own, the support from ChatGPT was instrumental in overcoming several technical challenges.
